Variables on the global level (done)

combining the different things into 

numbers for the different operators 

if else statements

0 is addition
1 is subtraction


if (operator === 0)
	result = firstNumber + secondNumber;
else if (operator === 1)
	result = firstNumber - secondNumber;

nesting the clicks inside eachother? (probably a bad idea)

firstNumber += thing;

password generator might have a thing for combining multiple numbers into a single series of numbers
instead of 5+5=10 it would be 5+5=55 (I think it made them into a string and doing +=)

general order:
click numbers
click operator
click numbers
click equals
display result

disable operators? (end thing, fine to not do)
